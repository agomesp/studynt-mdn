# Study Notes - MDN Front Curriculum
Goal: Write notes and summaries for the [MDN Front-End Curriculum](https://github.com/mdn/curriculum)
Status: In Progress

This is a work in progress as I study the provided contents. That doesn't mean I'll study every topic, some of them I already know. So I'll just consolidate my knowledge and write new things I don't know.
